    /// The ComCRC32 is the standard zip CRC32 checksum of the File Comment
    /// field in the central directory header.  This is used to verify that
    /// the comment field has not changed since the Unicode Comment extra field
    /// was created.  This can happen if a utility changes the File Comment 
    /// field but does not update the UTF-8 Comment extra field.  If the CRC 
    /// check fails, this Unicode Comment extra field SHOULD be ignored and 
    /// the File Comment field in the header SHOULD be used instead.
    /// 
    /// The UnicodeCom field is the UTF-8 version of the File Comment field
    /// in the header.  As UnicodeCom is defined to be UTF-8, no UTF-8 byte
    /// order mark (BOM) is used.  The length of this field is determined by
    /// subtracting the size of the previous fields from TSize.  If both the
    /// File Name and Comment fields are UTF-8, the new General Purpose Bit
    /// Flag, bit 11 (Language encoding flag (EFS)), can be used to indicate
    /// both the header File Name and Comment fields are UTF-8 and, in this
    /// case, the Unicode Path and Unicode Comment extra fields are not
    /// needed and SHOULD NOT be created.  Note that, for backward
    /// compatibility, bit 11 SHOULD only be used if the native character set
    /// of the paths and comments being zipped up are already in UTF-8. It is
    /// expected that the same file comment storage method, either general
    /// purpose bit 11 or extra fields, be used in both the Local and Central
    /// Directory Header for a file.
